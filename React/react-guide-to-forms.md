# A Beginner's Guide to Forms in React

Forms are an essential part of web applications—they allow users to interact with your app by submitting data. In React, handling forms may feel different compared to traditional HTML due to React's stateful, component-based architecture. This guide walks you through the fundamentals of working with forms in React, ensuring you feel confident building interactive and user-friendly forms.

## 1. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

### Controlled Components

In React, controlled components are form inputs that are controlled by the component's state. The component’s state serves as the single source of truth for the input’s value, which updates as the user interacts.

- **Advantages**:
  - Easier to read and maintain.
  - Simplifies form validation.
  - State updates are predictable.

### Uncontrolled Components

Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally, allowing you to retrieve their values using refs.

- **Note**: Controlled components are generally recommended in React due to better control over form data and easier debugging.
