# Beginner's Guide to React Forms

React forms are essential for collecting user input and handling events in a React application. This guide will introduce you to the basics of working with forms in React, including how to handle inputs, manage form submission, and work with controlled components.

## **What Are React Forms?**
In React, forms are used to collect and process user input. Unlike regular HTML forms, React handles form elements through its state, enabling more control and interactivity.

## **Key Concepts**
1. **Controlled Components**: Form elements whose value is controlled by React's state.
2. **State Management**: State is used to store and update form input values.
3. **Event Handling**: React uses synthetic events to handle form submissions and input changes.
4. **Validation**: Forms often include validation to ensure correct data is submitted.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### 1. **Set Up the Form Structure**
Start with a basic HTML form structure:
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type="text" />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 2. **Control the Input with State**
To make the form interactive, use React's `useState` to manage the value of the input field.
