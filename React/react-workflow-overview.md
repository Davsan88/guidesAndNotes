# React Workflow Overview: Working with Data, Props, and Destructuring

In React, managing data efficiently and passing it through components is a core practice. This guide walks you through handling external data files, using `.map()` to render multiple components, and passing data via props. We also explore destructuring to simplify working with props.

## Data File (data.js)

### Where the Data Originates

Your data typically resides in a separate file (like `data.js`), stored as an array of objects. Each object represents an individual entity (like a card, joke, or product) with various properties.

### Data Format Example

```javascript
export default [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Life Lessons with Katie Zaferes",
    price: 136,
    coverImg: "katie-zaferes.png",
    stats: {
      rating: 5.0,
      reviewCount: 6
    },
    location: "Online"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Learn Wedding Photography",
    price: 125,
    coverImg: "wedding-photography.png",
    stats: {
      rating: 5.0,
      reviewCount: 30
    },
    location: "Online"
  }
];
```

In this example, each object has properties such as `id`, `title`, `price`, `coverImg`, and `stats` (which itself is an object with properties like `rating` and `reviewCount`).

## App.jsx

### Central Hub of the Application

The `App.jsx` file is responsible for importing the data and using it to render child components dynamically. In this case, we use `.map()` to iterate over the data array and render a `Card` component for each item.

### Example:

```javascript
import data from './data'; // 1. Importing the data file

function App() {
  // 2. Using .map() to loop over the data array and create a Card component for each item
  const cardElements = data.map(({ id, title, price, coverImg, stats, location }) => (
    <Card 
      key={id} 
      title={title} 
      price={price} 
      coverImg={coverImg} 
      stats={stats} 
      location={location}
    />
  ));

  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />  {/* Static components */}
      <Hero />
      <div>
        { cardElements }  {/* Rendering the mapped Card components */}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### What Happens Here:

1. **Data Import**: The data array is imported from `data.js`.
2. **Mapping the Data**: The `.map()` method iterates over each object in the `data` array, destructuring properties (like `id`, `title`, and `price`) and passing them to the `Card` component.
3. **Passing Props**: Each `Card` component is passed individual props from the current object.

## Card.jsx

### Receiving and Destructuring Props

The `Card` component receives props from `App.jsx`, and these props are used to render the UI. Destructuring the props inside the component allows you to access them directly, simplifying the code.

### Example:

```javascript
const Card = ({ title, price, coverImg, stats: { rating, reviewCount }, location }) => {
  return (
    <div className='card'>
      <img className='card__image' src={coverImg} alt={title} />
      <div className='card__info'>
        <img src="star.png" alt="Star icon" className='card__star' />
        <span>{rating}</span>
        <span className='gray'>({reviewCount}) ·</span>
        <span className='gray'>{location}</span>
      </div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p><b>From ${price}</b> / person</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
```

### What Happens Here:

1. **Receiving Props**: The component receives the props (e.g., `title`, `price`, `coverImg`).
2. **Destructuring Nested Objects**: The `stats` object is destructured to directly access `rating` and `reviewCount` within the function signature.
3. **Rendering Dynamic Data**: The component uses the received props to display the appropriate information dynamically (e.g., image, title, rating).

## Information Flow (Step-by-Step):

### 1. **Data Definition (in data.js)**

The data is stored as an array of objects. Each object contains properties that represent different entities like cards or jokes.

### 2. **Data Importing (in App.jsx)**

The data is imported into `App.jsx`, which serves as the central hub of the application. The parent component controls the flow of data.

### 3. **Data Mapping (in App.jsx)**

In `App.jsx`, `.map()` is used to iterate over the array of objects and create a `Card` component for each item. This process generates an array of React components.

### 4. **Passing Props (in App.jsx)**

Inside the `.map()` function, individual properties from each object are passed down as props to the child component (`Card`). Each `Card` component gets its own set of data.

### 5. **Receiving Props (in Card.jsx)**

The `Card` component receives these props and can destructure them directly for easier access. It uses the data to render a dynamic UI.

### 6. **Rendering the Final Output (in the Browser)**

Each `Card` component is rendered on the page with its unique data, displaying different information based on the object it received from the data array.

## Summary:

1. **Data in `data.js`**: The raw data is defined as an array of objects.
2. **Import and Map**: The data is imported into `App.jsx`, where `.map()` is used to render a `Card` component for each item.
3. **Pass Props**: Each object’s properties are passed as props to the `Card` component.
4. **Receive and Destructure**: The `Card.jsx` component receives props and destructures them for clean and readable code.
5. **Render Dynamically**: The data is displayed dynamically, creating flexible, reusable components that adapt to changing data.

By using this workflow, you create modular, reusable components that dynamically update based on the data passed to them. This approach ensures that your UI can easily scale and adapt to new requirements.
