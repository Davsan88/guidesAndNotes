# Working with State Variables and useState in React

State variables in React allow components to manage and respond to dynamic data. Using the **useState** hook, you can add state to functional components, enabling them to track changes and update the UI accordingly. This is crucial for building interactive React applications, such as the Meme Generator app. Here's how you can effectively work with state variables and the `useState` hook.

## Key Concepts

- **State Variables**: Hold data that may change over time and affect what gets rendered in the UI.
- **useState Hook**: A React hook that allows you to add state to functional components.
- **State Initialization**: Setting the initial value of a state variable when a component mounts.
- **Updating State**: Changing the value of a state variable, which triggers a re-render of the component.
- **Functional Updates**: Using a function to update state based on the previous state value.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using State Variables with useState

### 1. Import the useState Hook

Before you can use `useState`, you need to import it from React:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
