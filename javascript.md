# JavaScript Quick Guide

JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic programming language widely used for web development to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It runs on the client's browser without the need for server-side processing. JavaScript can manipulate HTML content, respond to user events, validate data, and much more, making it an essential tool for front-end web development. It can also be used on the server-side through environments such as Node.js.

## Introduction to JavaScript

### `console.log()`

The `console.log()` method is used to print any specified message or variable value to the browser console. It's a helpful debugging tool.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Type of Comments

In JavaScript, comments can be written in two ways:

- Single-line comments, starting with `//`
- Multi-line comments, enclosed between `/*` and */`

Examples:
```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment
which spans over multiple lines
*/
```
