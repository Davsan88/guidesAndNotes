# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

## Cloud Concepts

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS.

### Evolution of Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting has evolved from traditional physical servers to virtualized infrastructure and now to fully managed cloud services. This progression has led to increased scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing needs and demands.

### What is Amazon?

Amazon.com, Inc. is a multinational technology company based in Seattle, Washington, that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry.

### What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS offers scalable, reliable, and low-latency cloud services.

### What is a CSP?

A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is a company that offers a component of cloud computing—typically Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), or Platform as a Service (PaaS)—to other businesses or individuals.

### Landscapes of CSPs

The landscape of CSPs includes several major players, each offering a range of cloud services. Key players include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. Each provider has its own strengths and specialties.

### Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud

The Gartner Magic Quadrant (MQ) for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services (CIPS) evaluates cloud providers based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. AWS consistently ranks as a leader in this quadrant, highlighting its strong market presence and comprehensive service offerings.

### Common Cloud Services

Common cloud services provided by CSPs include:

- **Compute**: Virtual machines, containers, serverless computing.
- **Storage**: Object storage, file storage, block storage.
- **Databases**: Managed relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Networking**: Virtual private clouds, load balancers, VPNs.
- **Security**: Identity and access management, encryption, compliance services.

### AWS Technology Overview

AWS provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services that support a wide range of applications, including computing, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications.

### Evolution of Computing

- **Dedicated Servers**: Dedicated servers are physical machines allocated to a single application or task, often resulting in underutilized resources and high operational costs.
- **Virtual Machines**: Virtual Machines (VMs) allow multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical machine through a hypervisor, improving resource utilization and scalability.
- **Containers**: Containers provide OS-level virtualization, enabling multiple isolated applications to run on a single OS kernel, offering faster start-up times and efficient resource utilization.
- **Functions**: Serverless computing, or Functions as a Service (FaaS), lets developers run code in response to events without managing servers, with automatic scaling and pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing services are generally categorized into three types:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on-demand, and typically on a subscription basis.

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.
- **Public Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure made available to the general public or a large industry group and owned by an organization selling cloud services.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology.
- **Cross-Cloud**: When using multiple cloud providers.

>Understanding these core concepts provides a solid foundation for leveraging AWS services effectively and aligns with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam requirements.

## The Benefits of Cloud

### The 6 Advantages of Cloud

1. **Trade Capital Expense (CAPEX) for Operational Expense (OPEX)**:
   Move from large upfront capital investments to pay-as-you-go pricing, reducing financial risk and improving cash flow.

2. **Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale**:
   AWS aggregates usage from hundreds of thousands of customers, achieving higher economies of scale and passing the savings onto customers.

3. **Stop Guessing Capacity**:
   Eliminate the need to guess infrastructure capacity needs, reducing the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources.

4. **Increase Speed and Agility**:
   Quickly deploy new resources and scale infrastructure in minutes, allowing for rapid innovation and time-to-market.

5. **Stop Spending Money on Running and Maintaining Data Centers**:
   Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure, by outsourcing data center operations to AWS.

6. **Go Global in Minutes**:
   Easily deploy applications in multiple regions around the world to provide lower latency and a better experience for customers.

### The 7 Advantages of Cloud

In addition to the six advantages mentioned above, the seventh advantage is often cited as:

7. **Improved Security**:
   Benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations, with comprehensive security and compliance controls.
