## Module 1: Introducction to Cloud Computing

### Why Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses scale and manage their IT resources. By leveraging cloud services, organizations can reduce operational costs, improve efficiency, and enhance scalability and flexibility in their operations.

### What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

#### Private Cloud
A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at the organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in either case, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network.

#### Public Cloud
Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet. AWS is an example of a public cloud provider.

#### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. This provides businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options by allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision resources as needed, automatically, without requiring human interaction with the service provider.
- **Broad network access**: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).
- **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**: Multiple customers can share the same physical infrastructures or applications, yet remain securely isolated, while resources can be dynamically allocated and reallocated according to demand.
- **Rapid elasticity and scalability**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
- **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).

### Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**: Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before knowing how you'll use them, you pay only when you consume computing resources and pay only for how much you consume.
- **Economies of scale**: Achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud.
- **Stop guessing capacity**: Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity.
- **Increase speed and agility**: In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.
- **Focus on projects that differentiate your business**, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
- **Go global in minutes**: Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

### Problems Solved by the Cloud

Cloud computing addresses various challenges, including:

- **Scalability issues**: Handling sudden increases in workload by enabling rapid expansion.
- **Capital cost concerns**: Reducing the need for upfront infrastructure investments.
- **Maintenance overheads**: Lowering the cost and effort associated with IT system upkeep.
- **Global reach**: Providing the ability to serve users worldwide efficiently.

### Cloud Computing Types

#### Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing services are primarily categorized into three types, which differ in the level of control and management required from the user:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users have an allocated storage capacity and can run any software, including operating systems and applications. This service offers the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools available over the internet. These services are mainly used by developers who are building software or applications. PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on-demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, such as software upgrades and security patching.

#### Example of Cloud Computing Types

- **IaaS**: Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity.
- **PaaS**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment to easily deploy and run applications without worrying about the infrastructure.
- **SaaS**: Amazon Chime is an example of a SaaS offering for video conferencing services.

#### Pricing of the Cloud (AWS)

Pricing in the cloud is a critical factor and varies based on the service model:

- **Compute**: Charged based on the compute capacity per hour or per second depending on the instance type rented.
- **Storage**: Priced per gigabyte per month based on the type of storage used (e.g., Amazon S3).
- **Data transfer OUT of the cloud**: Generally free for data transfer into the cloud but charged for data transfer out, depending on the amount of data moved and the destination.

### AWS Cloud Overview

AWS provides a broad set of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking, and databases, delivered as a utility: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines the security responsibilities of AWS and the customer to help ensure a secure and compliant environment. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. The customer responsibility is determined by the AWS service used. Customers retain control of the security measures they choose to protect their own content, platform, applications, systems, and networks.

- **AWS Responsibility**: "Security of the Cloud" - AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.
- **Customer Responsibility**: "Security in the Cloud" - Customers are responsible for security measures based on the AWS services they utilize. This can include updating and patching software, configuring AWS managed services, and securing application data.

Understanding these foundational elements about AWS and cloud computing types enhances your ability to leverage the AWS platform effectively, aligning with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam's requirements.
