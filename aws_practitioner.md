## Module 1: Introducction to Cloud Computing

### Why Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses scale and manage their IT resources. By leveraging cloud services, organizations can reduce operational costs, improve efficiency, and enhance scalability and flexibility in their operations.

### What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

#### Private Cloud
A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at the organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in either case, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network.

#### Public Cloud
Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet. AWS is an example of a public cloud provider.

#### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. This provides businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options by allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision resources as needed, automatically, without requiring human interaction with the service provider.
- **Broad network access**: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).
- **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**: Multiple customers can share the same physical infrastructures or applications, yet remain securely isolated, while resources can be dynamically allocated and reallocated according to demand.
- **Rapid elasticity and scalability**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
- **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
