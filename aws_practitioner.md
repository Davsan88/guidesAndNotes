## Cloud Concepts

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS.

### Evolution of Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting has evolved from traditional physical servers to virtualized infrastructure and now to fully managed cloud services. This progression has led to increased scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing needs and demands.

### What is Amazon?

Amazon.com, Inc. is a multinational technology company based in Seattle, Washington, that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry.

### What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS offers scalable, reliable, and low-latency cloud services.
