# Hello World: Welcome to Python

Welcome to Python, a powerful and versatile programming language that's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Comments

Comments in Python are created using the `#` symbol. Anything following the `#` on the same line is ignored by the Python interpreter.

- Example:
  ```python
  # This is a comment in Python
  ```

## Print

The `print()` function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).

- Example:
  ```python
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```

## Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

- Example:
  ```python
  print("This is a string.")
  print('This is also a string.')
  ```
