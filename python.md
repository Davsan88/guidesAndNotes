# Hello World: Welcome to Python

Welcome to Python, a powerful and versatile programming language that's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Comments

Comments in Python are created using the `#` symbol. Anything following the `#` on the same line is ignored by the Python interpreter.

- Example:
  ```python
  # This is a comment in Python
  ```

## Print

The `print()` function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).

- Example:
  ```python
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```

## Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

- Example:
  ```python
  print("This is a string.")
  print('This is also a string.')
  ```

 ## Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In Python, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

- Example:
  ```python
  x = 5
  y = "Hello, Python!"
  print(x)
  print(y)
  ```

## Errors

Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written.

NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize.

- Example:
  ```python
  # This will raise an error because "test" is not defined
  print(test)
  ```
