# Intro to React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.

## What's JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML in React and is a syntax extension for JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

## JSX Elements

A JSX element is defined with tags, very similar to HTML. It can either represent HTML tags or user-defined components.

- Example:
  ```jsx
  const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  ```

  ## Attributes In JSX

JSX elements can use attributes just like HTML, including classes, ids, and data-* attributes.

- Example:
  ```jsx
  const element = <img src="logo.png" className="logo" />;
  ```
