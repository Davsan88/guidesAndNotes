# **üîç What Is the Two Pointers Pattern?**

Imagine you have an **array** (or sometimes a **string**) and you want to solve a problem by examining **elements from different ends or positions simultaneously**. The **Two Pointers Pattern** uses **two indices (pointers)** that move through the data structure at **different speeds or directions**. 

This approach is particularly useful when the **data is sorted** or when you're **looking for pairs** or **certain relationships between elements**.
