# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)

## Cloud Concepts

### What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (the cloud), allowing for on-demand access to resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics.

### Common Cloud Services
Common cloud services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These services provide various levels of control, flexibility, and management.

### What is Microsoft and Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service created by Microsoft. It provides a range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Users can select and configure these services to meet their specific needs.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Cost-effective**: Reduces the need for upfront capital expenditure on hardware and software, offering a pay-as-you-go model.
- **Global**: Allows you to deploy applications in multiple regions worldwide, ensuring low latency and high availability.
- **Secure**: Provides robust security measures to protect data and applications, including compliance with various regulations.
- **Reliable**: Offers high availability and disaster recovery options to ensure business continuity.
- **Scalable**: Easily scales resources up or down to meet changing demand.
- **Elastic**: Automatically adjusts resources to handle variations in workload.
- **Current**: Ensures you always have access to the latest technologies and updates.

### Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing can be classified into three main types:

- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
- **Private Cloud**: Computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities

Cloud responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the customer:

- **Cloud Provider Responsibilities**: Physical infrastructure security, hardware maintenance, and network controls.
- **Customer Responsibilities**: Data security, access management, and application security.

### Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models include:

- **Public Cloud**: Fully managed by the cloud provider, accessible over the internet.
- **Private Cloud**: Exclusive to a single organization, offering greater control and privacy.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Integrates public and private clouds to leverage the benefits of both.

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) evaluates the cost of owning and operating an IT infrastructure over its entire lifecycle, including hardware, software, maintenance, and labor. Cloud computing often reduces TCO by minimizing upfront capital expenditures and converting them into operational expenditures.

### CAPEX vs OPEX

- **CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)**: Upfront costs for physical infrastructure, including hardware and software licenses. These are fixed, long-term investments.
- **OPEX (Operational Expenditure)**: Ongoing costs for running and maintaining infrastructure, including utility bills, maintenance, and subscription services. Cloud computing shifts many IT expenses from CAPEX to OPEX, offering more flexibility and cost efficiency.
